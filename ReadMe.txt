This is a preparation project for a WebGPU ocean in three.js. Therefore, many elements are still missing. 

In three.js webgpu I don't use renderTargets, but rather compute shaders. All the textfields serve as useful debuggers for me.
However this testapp already contains a powerful CDLOD which I was already able to implement also in my webGPU variant with wgsl. I have a lot of other projects that, when combined with a real ocean
that I want to create, result in a fully-fledged landscape or environment generator. I will add some pictures of my
terrain generator so you can get a better idea of ​​what it will become.

P.S.
screenshot 21 is a sunset on mars
screenshot 27 and 33 ist the earth. 

But an earth without an ocean looks bad, so I started creating an ocean. 
I also have an example app for a cloud generator here on github. With planet-wide clouds, 
a real ocean and detailed landmasses, this will be a detailed Earth.
