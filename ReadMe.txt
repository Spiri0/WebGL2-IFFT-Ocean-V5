This is a preparation project for a WebGPU ocean in three.js. Therefore, many elements are still missing. 

In three.js webgpu I don't use renderTargets, but rather compute shaders. All the textfields serve as useful debuggers for me.
However this testapp already contains a powerful CDLOD which I was already able to implement also in my weggpu variant with wgsl. I have a lot of other projects that, when combined with a real ocean that I want to create, result in a fully-fledged landscape generator. I will add some pictures of my terrain generator so you can get a better idea of ​​what it will become.
